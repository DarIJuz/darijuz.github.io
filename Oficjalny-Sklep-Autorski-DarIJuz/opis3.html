  <p>
    This book is not a continuation of *Women Who Run with the Wolves* in a literal sense, but its echo — 
    a reflection through the eyes of a man who walks the path of empathy, relationships, and inner transformation.
  </p>

  <p>
    *Following the Trails of the One Who Runs with the Wolves* explores the space between love and dependency,
    warmth and control, tenderness and strength. It’s a mirror of modern relationships — revealing both the hunger for closeness
    and the courage to find oneself again.
  </p>

  <p>
    The author leads the reader with poetic sensitivity and psychological depth — offering understanding, not judgment.
    Each page is an invitation to reflection, to gentleness, and to the rediscovery of one’s own inner voice.
